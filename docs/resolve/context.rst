Application Context
===================

The application context passed to your field resolvers is normally set by the initial call to
:api:`/execute`.
Lacinia uses the context for its own book-keeping (the keys it places into the map are namespaced to
avoid collisions) but otherwise the same map is passed to all field resolvers.

In specific cases, it is useful to allow a field resolver to modify the application context, with the change
exposed just to the fields nested below, but to any depth.

For example, in this query::

  {
    products(search: "fuzzy") {
      category {
        name
        product {
          upc
          name
          highlightedName
        }
     }
  }

Here, the search term is provided to the ``products`` field, but is again needed by the ``highlightedName``
field, to highlight the parts of the name that match the search term.

The resolver for the ``products`` field can communicate this information
"down tree" to the resolver for the ``highlighted_name`` field, by
using the :api:`resolve/with-context` function.

.. literalinclude:: /_examples/mutable-context.edn
   :language: clojure
   :emphasize-lines: 7

The map provided to ``with-context`` will be merged into the application context before any nested resolvers are invoked.
In this way, the new key, ``::search-term``, is only present in the context for field resolvers below ``products`` field.

Some field resolvers returns lists of values; the entire list can be wrapped in this way **OR** individual values within the
list may be wrapped.

.. tip::

   Remember that query execution is top to bottom, then the final result map is assembled from the leaves back up to
   the roots.


When using `lacinia-pedestal <https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal>`_, the default behavior is to capture the Ring request map and supply it
in the application context under the ``:request`` key.
