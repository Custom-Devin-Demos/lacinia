   wrap-up

Our goal with this tutorial is to build up the essentials of a full application
implemented in Lacinia, starting from nothing.

Unlike many of the snippets used elsewhere in the Lacinia documentation, this will be something
you can fork and experiment with yourself.

Along the way, we hope you'll learn quite a bit about not just Lacinia and GraphQL,
but about building Clojure applications in general.
