Pre-Requisites
==============

You should have a basic understanding of GraphQL, which you can pick up from this documentation,
and from `the GraphQL home page <https://graphql.org/>`_.

You should be familiar with, but by no means an expert in, Clojure.

You should have a `recent build of Clojure <https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure>`_, including the ``clj`` command.

You should have an editor or IDE ready to go, set up for editing Clojure code.

A skim of the Lacinia reference documentation (the rest of this manual, outside of
this tutorial) is also helpful, or you can follow links provided as we go.

The later chapters use a database stored in a Docker container;
you should download and install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and
ensure that you can run the ``docker`` command.
