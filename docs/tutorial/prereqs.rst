Pre-Requisites
==============

You should be familiar with, but by no means an expert in, Clojure.

You should have a `recent build of Clojure <https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure>`_, including the ``clj`` command.

You should have an editor or IDE ready to go, set up for editing Clojure code.

A skim of the Lacinia reference documentation (the rest of this manual, outside of
this tutorial) is also helpful.
Or you can follow links provided as we go.
