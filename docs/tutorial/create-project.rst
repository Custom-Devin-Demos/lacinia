Creating the Project
====================

In this first step of the tutorial, we'll create the initial empty project, and set up the
initial dependencies.

Let's get started.

The first step is to create a new, empty project::

  12:51:44 ~/workspaces/github > lein new clojure-game-geek
  Generating a project called clojure-game-geek based on the 'default' template.
  The default template is intended for library projects, not applications.
  To see other templates (app, plugin, etc), try `lein help new`.

Although Leiningen has an ``app`` template, it is not significantly different than the default
template.

Normally, we might delete some files we don't need, such as :file:`.hgignore` and the default :file:`doc` directory,
but for simplicity we'll just ignore those.

Initially, the :file:`project.clj` is almost empty:

.. literalinclude:: /_examples/tutorial/project-1.clj
   :caption: project.clj

Our first step is to fill in a few details, including the dependency on Lacinia:

.. literalinclude:: /_examples/tutorial/project-2.clj
   :caption: project.clj
   :emphasize-lines: 2,3,7-9

Lacinia has just a few dependencies of its own:

.. graphviz::

    digraph {
      graph [rankdir=TD];
      "clojure-game-geek-1216" [label="clojure-game-geek/
      clojure-game-geek
      0.1.0-SNAPSHOT",shape=doubleoctagon];
      "clojure-1217" [label="org.clojure/
      clojure
      1.8.0"];
      "lacinia-1218" [label="com.walmartlabs/
      lacinia
      0.21.0"];
      "clj-antlr-1219" [label="clj-antlr
      0.2.4"];
      "antlr4-1220" [label="org.antlr/
      antlr4
      4.5.3"];
      "antlr4-runtime-1221" [label="org.antlr/
      antlr4-runtime
      4.5.3"];
      "clojure-future-spec-1222" [label="clojure-future-spec
      1.9.0-alpha17"];
      "ordered-1223" [label="org.flatland/
      ordered
      1.5.6"];
      "useful-1224" [label="org.flatland/
      useful
      0.9.0"];
      "clojure-game-geek-1216" -> "clojure-1217";
      "clojure-game-geek-1216" -> "lacinia-1218";
      "lacinia-1218" -> "clj-antlr-1219";
      "lacinia-1218" -> "clojure-future-spec-1222";
      "lacinia-1218" -> "ordered-1223";
      "clj-antlr-1219" -> "antlr4-1220";
      "clj-antlr-1219" -> "antlr4-runtime-1221";
      "ordered-1223" -> "useful-1224";
    }

`Antlr <http://www.antlr.org/>`_ is used to parse GraphQL queries and schemas.
``org.flatland/ordered`` provides the ordered map type, used to ensure that response
keys and values are in the client-specified order, as per the GraphQL spec.

Like any open source project, Lacinia is evolving all the time.
In later tutorial steps, we will change these dependencies to access newly added Lacinia features.
