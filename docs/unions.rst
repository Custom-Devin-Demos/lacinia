Unions
======

A union type is a type that may be any of a list of possible objects.

.. sidebar:: GraphQL Spec

   Read about :spec:`unions <Unions>`.

A union is a type defined in terms of different objects:

.. literalinclude:: _examples/union-definition.edn
   :language: clojure

A union definition must include a ``:members`` key, a sequence of object types.

The above example identifies the ``SearchResult` union type to be either a ``Person`` (with fields
``name`` and ``age``), or a ``Photo`` (with fields ``imageURL``, ``title``, ``height``, and ``width``).

Unions must define at least one type; each member type must be an object type (members may not be
reference scalar types, interfaces, or other unions).

When a client makes a union request, they must use the fragment spread syntax to identify what
is to be returned based on the runtime type of object:

.. code-block:: js

   { search (term:"ewok") {
     ... on Person { name }
     ... on Photo { imageURL title }
   }}

This breaks down what will be returned in the result map based on the type of the value produced
by the ``search`` query.  Sometimes there will be a ``name`` key in the result, and other times
an ``image-url`` and ``title`` key.
This may vary result by result even within a single request:

.. literalinclude:: _examples/unions-query-response.edn
   :language: clojure

.. tip::

   When a field or operation type is a union,
   the field resolver may return any of a number of different
   concrete object types, and Lacinia has no way to determine which;
   this information must be :doc:`explicitly provided <resolve/type-tags>`.
